            <p>I adored the idea of Legos. They had immensive amount of detail put in to them, yet they were just small, plastic little colored blocks. How were they fun? It was so creative. You could make whatever you wanted. Your mind is your limit, and for people who don't know how to get ideas right away, they have many lego sets, which id to seperate titles they make the lego sets of, like Indiana Jones, The LEGO Movie, and Star Wars. If you needed ideas, they were everywhere, with the sets, to the blocks. I used to have a box of legos, and used to build the craziest stuff. One time, Me and my brother made a huge lego fort, and it was so cool. I used to watch a lot of LEGO Hero Factory with my friend Isaiah all the time, and he would bring his bionicle toys to school, and I would bring my Hero Factory toys, eventually Isaiah got his own, and made his own heros, as did I. eventually, what really sucked is LEGO Hero Factory was eventually removed from LEGO entirely, and almost completely forgotten. Me and Isaiah still adored that stuff though, as we would talk about it everyday at lunch and after school. LEGO was just a conglomerate and they had access to so many companys and popular titles, like Star Wars, DC, Marvel and those all are multi-million dollar brands. They were everywhere and everyone knew what they were. The extremely awesome part about LEGO is the letter I got. When I was kid, probably around 11 years old, I was so hyped to see the sequel of The LEGO Movie after seeing the original (which just came out, still haven't seen). Not only that, I would mail a letter to LEGO corporation asking for a release date.	&#x1f926; Eventually, though, about 1 year later, I got a response,saying basically NO, but they appreciate the support and they were working on it! It was such a funny part of my childhood that I love to look back on and remember. What else I used to love about LEGOS was the things you built. I remember a thing I would always do as a kid, is have a simple lego foundation, so I could build houses, gardens, even mansion, buildings, and skyscrapers! Then I would build for a very long time,creating weird,  and  complex structures, and using the brain that I had, I built wonders. I loved LEGOs and the way it could be used for creativity and passion for projects. It truly inspired me to love and express creativity, no matter where you are. To think that LEGO's been around for 70+ years! It is a marvel to see this company grow <strong>EVEN</strong> more quickly then and <strong>EVEN</strong> more quickly now. I dreamed of being a Lego Engineer, but technology sucks, because now I'm starting to love it. LEGOs will always be remembered by me as an awesome childhood toy.</p>
